        summary: "This exhibition consists of the robotic, AI prostheses created by Marco Donnarumma with a team of collaborators for his [7 Configurations] cycle. 7 Configurations is a cycle of performances and installations that focuses on the conflicts surrounding the human body in the era of artificial intelligence (AI). Through combined research on movement, dramaturgy, sound and technological engineering, each of the works in the cycle combines human bodies, robotic hardware, machine learning software and microorganisms into a particular ‘configuration’.",
