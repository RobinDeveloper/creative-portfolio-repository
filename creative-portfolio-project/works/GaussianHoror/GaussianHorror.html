                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>For this project we were asked to work with AI, or other systems. I decided to play around with gaussian splatting, being very intrigued by the 3D space they create when you don't use videos that are made for gaussian splatting but once that are messy and quick cuts. These images created a weird non-euclidian space that felt eldritch to me. So I let you n VR explore the explorable, the unimaginability of cosmic horror. A being that is asleep like azatoth but holds our planet in its mind. When going trough the being you sometimes find places recognisable but with the slightest movement it dissapears again. Looking into dimensions you cannot comprihend. This project is best expierenced in VR.</p>
