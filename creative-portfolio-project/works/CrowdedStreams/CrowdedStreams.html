                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p><strong>Crowded streams</strong> is a work designed around the movement of people in public spaces. This street full of people will be represented as a stream. A project started with looking at the movement of people and seeing flocking patterns ended up getting me to this livestream where it looks like people are just a stream of particles, moving at roughly the same speed, roughly the same density, and direction A.K.A variables you can also give to water. So here you see the algorithms analysing the people and representing them as a sometimes a calm, sometimes a wild stream of water.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>This project all started underwater, so in a way I didn't drift far. I wanted to create a deep sea dreadfull expierence where the longer you sat in the simulation the more creepy and dreadfull it became.
                After realising how boring this was, I decided to pivot. I looked at what I did like about the project and that was the flocking I had written for the fish ad started thinking about how other species also flock and co-exist.
                I started looking at people in trainstations. Their movement, patterns, controlled chaos. Whilst looking for trainstations I also found this street in japan which intrigued me. It gave me this weird feeling of looking at a river.
                Seeing this I started to analyze these people. This I made into a program that could live translate the livestream to an abstract artwork all in realtime for the observer to see what I see.</p>
